# UdacityProject---Analyze-AB-TestResults

This project will assure me have learned the subjects covered in the statistics lessons.   
The expectation is to have this project be as comprehensive of these topics as possible.  

### Description  

 In this project a dataset containing the conversion rates between new and old websites for an e-commerce website is going to be analyzed. This project is meant to give a practical example for how the statistics learned in part 3 of the Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree course can be used.  

 The data will be used to perform an A/B test, the goal is to work through the notebook to help the community understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old one or run the experiment longer to make their decision.  
 
 What do I need to install?  
 You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:  
 * pandas  
 * NumPy  
 * Matplotlib  
 * csv  

 It will be recommend to installing Anaconda, which comes with all of the necessary packages, as well as IPython notebook.
